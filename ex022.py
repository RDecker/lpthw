No code, all review.
1. Go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol (another name for "character") that you have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.
2. Next to each word or symbol, write its name and what it does. If you can't find a name for a symbol in this book, then look for it online. If you do not know what a word or symbol does, then read about it again and try using it in some code.
